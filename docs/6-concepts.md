An OpenApi.yaml for this service can be found under:
"backend/src/main/resources/static/discovery-finder-openapi.yaml" [Link](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-discovery-finder/blob/main/backend/src/main/resources/static/discovery-finder-openapi.yaml)


### Security / Safety / Use of JWT Token

The whole environment is secured with OAuth2. We used and recommend the usage of Keycloak. The Discovery Finder has
a realm entry in Keycloak. Every user who wants to use Discovery Finder
need the corresponding roles for his user.

The roles are:

1. [ ] *VIEW*( "view_discovery_endpoint" )
2. [ ] *ADD*( "add_discovery_endpoint" )
3. [ ] *DELETE*( "delete_discovery_endpoint" )

These roles are sent within a JWT Token generated by Keycloak.

With all three roles it is possible to add and delete entries from the
Discovery Finder Database. For searching the view role is sufficient.
The credentials are set with entries in Helm Charts.
